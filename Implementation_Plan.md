### Deployment Flow (Actual Implementation)

#### Primary Method (Working):
1. Developer runs `npm run build`
2. Run `npm run deploy:azure`
3. SWA CLI deploys directly to Azure
4. Site updates within seconds

#### Secondary Method (Being Fixed):
1. Developer pushes to main branch
2. GitHub Actions workflow triggers
3. Workflow builds Astro site
4. Deployment fails due to token issue
5. Manual intervention required

- [x] All assets load properly from CDN

## Actual Challenges Encountered & Solutions

1. **Project Structure Issue**:
   - Problem: Created Astro project in subdirectory
   - Solution: Reorganized entire project to repository root

2. **GitHub Actions Token Issue**:
   - Problem: Secret `AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN` not being read
   - Solution: Implemented direct deployment via SWA CLI

3. **Deployment Method**:
   - Problem: GitHub Actions workflow failing
   - Solution: Created `deploy-azure.sh` script using SWA CLI

4. **Infrastructure Deployment**:
   - Problem: Need to provision Azure resources first
   - Solution: Used Bicep templates to deploy infrastructure

## Next Steps After Implementation

1. Fix GitHub Actions token authentication issue
2. Set up custom domain
3. Configure SSL certificate (automatic with custom domain)
4. Implement analytics (Google Analytics or Azure App Insights)
5. Set up monitoring and alerts
6. Create content update workflow

## Current Deployment Commands
